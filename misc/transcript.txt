-------------------
It seems that there was an issue retrieving the WETH balance for the address **0x0000Bb8c7B69d6c1a8D6A58A3c3B1757A37C08ce**. The balanceOf function might not be available or the address provided may not be correct.

The WETH contract address is **0xb4fbf271143f4fbf7b91a5ded31805e42b2208d6**, which is correct. However, please check if the address you provided is valid.
-------------------

Prompt: The WETH address is wrong actually, please check the WETH chaintool details.

{
  tool: "getToolByIndexAction",

}
The tool: "WETH" at address 0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006 has the following functions defined by their ABI types:
 - `function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance)`
 - `function transfer(address dst, uint256 wad) external returns (bool success)`
 - `function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 wad) external returns (bool success)`
 - `function approve(address guy, uint256 wad) external returns (bool success)`
 - `function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256 remaining)`
 - `function deposit() public payable`
 - `function withdraw(uint wad) public`
 - `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint supply)`
-------------------
The correct WETH contract address is **0x4200000000000000000000000000000000000006**. 

The available functions for the WETH Chaintool are:

- `function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256 balance)`
- `function transfer(address dst, uint256 wad) external returns (bool success)`
- `function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint256 wad) external returns (bool success)`
- `function approve(address guy, uint256 wad) external returns (bool success)`
- `function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256 remaining)`
- `function deposit() public payable`
- `function withdraw(uint wad) public`
- `function totalSupply() public view returns (uint supply)`

I will now use the correct WETH contract address to check the balance for **0x0000Bb8c7B69d6c1a8D6A58A3c3B1757A37C08ce**.
